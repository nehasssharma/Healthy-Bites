        <h1 class="heading">What is Macronutrient ?</h1><br>
        <p class="subheading">Macronutrients are nutrients that your body needs in large amounts to function optimally. The three main macronutrients are carbohydrates, protein, and fat. They're considered essential nutrients, meaning your body either cannot make them or cannot make enough of them. <b>For example,</b> proteins provide essential amino acids, while fats contain essential fatty acids. Your body utilizes these components for specific functions.Macronutrients also contain energy in the form of calories. Carbs are the main energy source, but your body can use other macronutrients for energy if needed.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Protein, fat, and carbohydrates each contain a different amount of energy per gram (g). This article will refer to kilocalories (kcal) as simply calories.</p><br>
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p class="subheading">The body needs proteins for the building and repair of tissues, cellular communication, enzymatic reactions, immune function, and more.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Examples of foods rich in protein include meat, fish, eggs, beans, tofu, and nuts.</p>
        <p class="subheading">There are approximately 4 calories in 1 g of protein. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends adults get 10-35%Trusted Source of their daily calories from protein. However, that amount may vary. It changes depending on a person’s age, body composition goals, muscle mass, and more.</p>
            <ul class="subheading">
                <li><b>Function :- </b>Build and repair tissues, including muscles, bones, and skin.</li>
                <li><b>Recommended daily intake :- </b>10-35% of total daily calories.</li>
                <li><b>source :- </b>Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and nuts.</li>
                <li><b>Types :- </b>Essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids.</li>
            </ul><br>
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p class="subheading">Carbohydrates, or carbs, are made up of sugar, starch, and fiber. They are the body’s main source of energy.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Examples of foods rich in carbs include potatoes, rice, pasta, fruit, beans, and oats.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per 1 g, and the DGA recommends adults get 45-65%Trusted Source of their daily calories from carbs.</p>
        <p class="subheading">People sometimes associate carbs with processed, less nutritious food items, such as cookies and white bread. However, many nutritious carbs are an essential basis of a balanced diet. Many of these foods are high in fiber and help keep a person full longer.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Additionally, the energy provided by carbs is essential for fueling the body and brain.</p>
        <p class="subheading">The amount of carbs a person needs varies. Some people thrive on lower carb diets, while others require a diet higher in carbs.</p>
       <ul class="subheading">
                <li><b>Function :- </b>Provide energy for the body, particularly for the brain and muscles.</li>
                <li><b>Recommended daily intake :- </b>45-65% of total daily calories.</li>
                <li><b>source :- </b>Grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products.</li>
                <li><b>Types :- </b>Simple carbohydrates (sugars), complex carbohydrates (starches and fibers).</li>
           </ul><br>
        <h2>fats</h2>
        <p class="subheading">Fat helps a person’s body store energy. It also protects the nerves, regulates hormones, aids in nutrient absorption, and maintains body temperature.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Examples of high fat foods include butter, oil, avocado, nuts, fatty fish, and meat.</p>
        <p class="subheading">There are 9 calories in 1 g of fat. According to the DGA, adults should get 20-35%Trusted Source of their daily calories from fat. Although the diet industry has historically vilified fat, it is essential for a healthy body.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Some fats may be a better choice than others. Saturated fat, which is solid at room temperature, should be consumed in moderation by most people. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than per day.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Unsaturated fat, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat, is liquid at room temperature. Nuts, seeds, avocados, and oily fish contain these fats. These are healthy fats, and diets that contain a good amount of these fats have associations with many health benefits.</p>
            <ul class="subheading">
                <li><b>Function :- </b>Provide energy, help absorb vitamins, and maintain healthy skin and hair.</li>
                <li><b>Recommended daily intake :- </b>20-35% of total daily calories.</li>
                <li><b>source :- </b>Oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and fatty fish.</li>
                <li><b>Types :- </b>- Saturated fats, unsaturated fats, trans fats.
                </li>
            </ul><br>
        <h3>Importance of Macronutrient Balance</h3>
        <p class="subheading">A balanced macronutrient intake is essential for maintaining optimal health and preventing chronic diseases. An imbalance can lead to :-</p>
        <ul class="subheading">
            <li>Weight gain or loss.</li>
            <li>Energy fluctuations.</li>
            <li>Poor athletic performance.</li>
            <li>Increased risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>What should my macro breakdown be?</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Each macronutrient is incredibly important for your body to function optimally. It’s crucial that you get enough carbs, protein, and fat by eating a balanced diet comprising a variety of foods.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Specifically, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines recommend these Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) for adults :- </p>
        <ul class="subheading">
        <li><b>Carbs :</b>45–65% of your daily calories.</li>
        <li><b>Protein :</b>10–35% of your daily calories.</li>
        <li><b>Fat :</b>20–35% of your daily calories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subheading">The guidelines also recommend that adults get at least 130 grams of carbs per day. This is the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and considered the amount necessary to provide your brain with enough glucose.</p>
        <p class="subheading">If there isn’t enough glucose available — which can happen if you’re following a strict keto diet or have issues regulating your insulin levels due to conditions like diabetes — your body is able to get energy by breaking down fat and protein.</p>
        <p class="subheading">When it comes to protein, the RDA for adults is at least 0.36 grams per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Keep in mind, though, that the appropriate amount of macronutrients for each person varies based on their age, activity levels, sex, and other circumstances.</p>
        <p class="subheading">If you’re trying to lose weight, you might benefit from eating slightly below the recommended range of calories from carbs and above the range recommended for protein. Extra protein can help you feel full, while fewer carbs can promote a calorie deficit.</p><br>
        <h3>Tips for Achieving a Balanced Macronutrient Breakdown</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Here are some tips to help you achieve a balanced macronutrient breakdown:</p>
        <ul class="subheading">
            <li>Determine your daily calorie needs based on your age, sex, weight, height, and activity level.</li>
            <li>Allocate your daily calories into the recommended macronutrient ranges.</li>
            <li>Eat a variety of foods to ensure you are getting all the necessary nutrients.</li>
            <li>Monitor your body's response and adjust your macronutrient breakdown as needed.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Should you be counting macros?</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Counting macros is an increasingly popular tactic for people interested in losing weight. Some athletes or individuals who need specific amounts of a certain macro, such as protein for muscle building, also use this strategy.</p>
        <p class="subheading">It usually involves coming up with a goal percentage of calories from each macro group and planning your meals accordingly</p>
        <p class="subheading">While macro counting can be an effective way for some people to reach their goals, it’s not necessary for everyone. In fact, if you eat a well-balanced diet with sources of each macronutrient, you likely meet the recommended intakes.</p>
        <p class="subheading"><b>For example,</b>simply building a balanced plate at each meal is a great way to ensure that you get enough carbs, proteins, and fats.</p>
        <p class="subheading">A rule of thumb is to fill about half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables, a quarter with high fiber carbs like fruit or whole grains, and the last quarter with a source of protein. Also, prioritize using healthy fats when cooking.</p>
        <p class="subheading">If you’re interested in further assessing your macronutrient intake, consider working with a registered dietitian to help you figure out and meet your needs.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Remember, the quality of the macros in your diet is more important than meeting a set amount every day.
        <p class="subheading"><b>For example,</b> if you eat sugary treats and refined carbs to meet your daily carb goal, you won’t get nearly as many nutrients and fiber as you would by eating fruits, veggies, and whole grains.</p><br>
        <h3>Considerations and risks</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Before starting a macro diet, a person should consider the following.</p>
        <h2>Takes time</h2>
        <p class="subheading">Tracking macros takes time. Unlike tracking calories, following a macro diet requires a person to pay close attention to the macronutrient ratio of everything they eat.</p>
        <h2>Lack of nutrient diversity</h2>
        <p class="subheading">A macro diet could lead to a lack of nutrient diversity. It can be easy to overlook essential micronutrients because the diet focuses on protein, carbs, and fat.</p>
        <p class="subheading">A person following the macro diet does not need to consume nutritious food. The only guidelines are that the food falls within the acceptable macronutrient ranges. Consistently making poor dietary choices may lead to a variety of health problems.</p>
        <h2>Socially restrictive</h2>
        <p class="subheading">Some people may find a macro diet socially restrictive. For example, a person may be less likely to go to dinner with friends because it is difficult to count the macros of food prepared by someone else.</p>
        <h2>Potential for disordered eating</h2>
        <p class="subheading">Perhaps the most significant risk associated with counting macros is disordered eating.</p>
        <p class="subheading">In a 2017 studyTrusted Source involving people who had received an eating disorder diagnosis, most participants said the My Fitness Pal tracking app contributed to their eating disorder.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Another 2017 study showed an association between calorie counting and regular health tracking with eating disorder attitudes and behaviors. This suggests that an intense focus on tracking health may even put people who do not have a history of eating disorders at risk for developing disordered eating behaviors.</p><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Macronutrients — proteins, fats, and carbs — play essential roles in major bodily functions. Keeping track of a person’s macro intake may help some people reach their health and fitness goals.</p>
        <p class="subheading">However, for others, counting macros is time-consuming and restrictive. While there are benefits to counting macros, there are also risks. It is advisable to talk with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist before starting a macro diet.</p>
